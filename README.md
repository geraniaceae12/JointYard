# JointYard
This repository contains a Python package designed for analyzing pose tracking data obtained (from software like [Lightning Pose](https://github.com/danbider/lightning-pose)).
The toolkit provides methods for processing and interpreting joint coordinate data to study behavioral patterns.
It is designed to analyze large-scale datasets with minimal supervision, capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics of behavior. 
By leveraging unsupervised learning and nonlinear dynamic embeddings (e.g., VAE), **JointYard** uncovers complex behavioral hierarchies and transitions over time. The system is scalable and automated, making it ideal for high-throughput behavioral analysis in naturalistic settings. Ultimately, this framework serves as a foundation for integrating behavioral and neural data, paving the way for a comprehensive understanding of brain-behavior relationships in future studies.

## Getting Started
Detailed installation instructions and package structure will be added soon.
